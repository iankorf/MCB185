data directory
==============

Storing genomic data in git repos is generally a bad idea. The exception is
demonstration or test data (the files here fall under these categories).

## E. coli ##

Escherichia coli strain K-12 standard files from NCBI downloaded 2022-12-19.

+ `GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.fna.gz`
+ `GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.gbff.gz`
+ `GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_genomic.gff.gz`
+ `GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2_protein.faa.gz`

## Model Organisms ##

Sequence (fasta) and annotation (gff) files are provided for 3 famous model
organisms. The first 1 percent of each chromosome is represented in FASTA and
GFF formats.

+ A. thaliana
+ C. elegans
+ D. melanogaster

The C. elegans genome also has a pseudo-vcf file with variant information.
