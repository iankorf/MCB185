## Intent ##

In this course, you will learn computer programming in a biological context.
This is not so much a science course as a software engineering course with a
molecular biology theme. Along with programming, you will be introduced to some
essential bioinformatics skills and standards.

## Experience, Aptitude, and Grading ##

Some students come to the class with previous programming experience. Some
students learn programming concepts faster than others. Some students have more
time to study than others. For these reasons, not every student will start or
end at the same place. In order to accommodate different learning trajectories,
there are 2 tracks through the course: standard and accelerated.

On the standard track, the class moves at a pace that matches the numeric
syllabus (Unit 0 through Unit 9). The maximum grade on the standard track is a
B+. In order to attain the maximum grade, you must have completed all of the
homework assignments correctly and have been an active participant in class.

Any student, at any time, may decide to go to the accelerated track and learn
extra content (Unit A through Unit F). The only way to earn an A-, A, or A+ is
on the accelerated track. Being on the accelerated track doesn't guarantee a
higher grade. You must still complete all of the assignments on the standard
track correctly and be an active participant in the class.

## Programming Progression ##

Your development as a programmer will not be linear. Some concepts will be easy
and others will be difficult. In order to become a high level programmer, you
need to understand about 100 new concepts. Each of these concepts will make you
pause for between 1 minute and forever. How long you get stuck is partly up to
you. You might not be able to get to the next level of understanding by
yourself. The solution is to **ask for help**. If you find yourself stuck for
more than 20 minutes, stop banging your head against a wall and ask someone for
help! Every time you ask for help, at least two people win.

Unlike most of your other classes, there is no penalty for working with another
student. In fact, you're _encouraged_ to do so. Programming _should_ be done in
pairs or small groups. That's how software gets written in the real world, so
that's how we should do it in class.

## No Shortcuts ##

This is foremost a course about _how_ to program. When faced with a homework
problem, such as "compute the descriptive statistics for a set of numbers", you
could very easily `import statistics` instead of writing the code yourself. In
a professional setting, you _should_ do that. However, the goal here isn't to
_solve_ a problem but to _learn_ how to solve a problem. For this reason, it's
important for you to write your own code. Even when you work in a small group,
everyone should write their own code.

Resist copy-paste. Typing words helps you remember what you did later.
Copy-paste is one of the worst ways to learn how to program. Also, copy-paste
is one of the greatest sources of silent programming errors.

In this course, you are not allowed to use any concept unless it has been
introduced in a previous or current unit. Do you already know how to write
functions? Good for you, but you aren't allowed to use them until they have
been formally introduced in unit 6. Want to use numpy or pandas? Sorry, we
never use those in this course. Looking up answers on the Internet will
frequently end with code that you're not allowed to use. Assignments with
_illegal_ solutions will be marked as incorrect and receive no credit.

## Course Content ##

Each unit of the course corresponds to 1 week. This is the standard track.

+ Unit 0: Tools of the Trade
+ Unit 1: Basic Unix
+ Unit 2: Beginning Python (Variables, Math, Conditionals, and Loops)
+ Unit 3: Containers (Strings, Tuples, and Lists)
+ Unit 4: Algorithms
+ Unit 5: Algoirthms
+ Unit 6: Functions and Files
+ Unit 7: Executables and CLI
+ Unit 8: Dictionaries
+ Unit 9: Final Project

Content on the accelerated track can be completed in any order.

+ Unit A: Regular Expressions
+ Unit B: Complex Data Structures
+ Unit C: Object-Oriented Programming
+ Unit D: Exceptions and Testing
+ Unit E: Documentation
+ Unit F: Interprocess Communication

## Getting Good ##

One of the best ways to practice programming is to write the same program over
and over. Repetition is just as important in programming as it is in something
like music or sports. After spending 30 minutes writing a program, you might
feel like throwing it away and re-writing it would be dumb. And yet, it's the
smartest thing you can do.

## Getting Help ##

The instructor and TA monitor the course Discord server, so asking questions in
the #mcb185 channel will get you the fastest response. You may get answers from
other students even sooner. Email will also work.

## Getting Started ##

This course is organized as a GitHub repository. GitHub is a website that lets
you store and manage Git repositories. While Git was designed for source code
management, it can be used to manage all kinds of projects. Git allows multiple
people to work on the same files without anyone over-writing anyone else's
work. You will always know who did what and when.

There are several services similar to GitHub, but GitHub is the most popular.
Every bioinformatics developer should have a GitHub account. Your repositories
and activity are part of your CV. If you don't have a GitHub account, it's time
to point your web browser to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an
account.

Choose a username. Your GitHub account will be part of your CV, so choose a
name that you won't be embarrassed by in a few years. I use my full name. After
setting your email and password, choose the free plan and then answer a few
questions about your interests to create your account. Go to your email to
verify your email address.

Point your web browser to https://github.com/iankorf/MCB185. At the top of the
page, there is a button labeled **Fork**. Click the button. This will present a
page with a **Create Fork** button at the bottom. By clicking this button, you
will add a copy of the course materials to your personal GitHub account. You
are now ready to start Unit 0 (look at the `README.md` file there).
