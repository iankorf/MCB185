## Intent ##

In this course, you will learn computer programming in a biological context.
This is not so much a science course as a software engineering course with a
molecular biology theme. Along with programming, you will be introduced to some
essential bioinformatics skills and standards.

## Experience, Aptitude, Participation, and Grading ##

Some students come to the class with previous programming experience. Some
students learn programming concepts faster than others. Some students have more
time to study than others. For these reasons, not every student will start or
end at the same place. In order to accommodate different learning trajectories,
there are 2 tracks through the course: standard and accelerated.

On the standard track (Unit 0 through Unit 9), the class is paced at 1 week per
unit. The maximum grade on the standard track is A-. For those who want more
advanced content, or a higher grade, there is an accelerated track (Unit A
through Unit F). Being on the accelerated track doesn't guarantee a higher
grade. You must still complete all of the assignments on the standard track
correctly.

Programming _should_ be done in pairs or small groups. For this reason,
participation is a large part of your grade. There are multiple ways to
participate.

+ Attendance in class during the scheduled time
+ Attendance in online _coderie_ sessions (see below)
+ Activity in the class Discord channel
+ Collaborative coding activities
	+ Organizing a group
	+ Joining a group
	+ Asking for help
	+ Providing help
	+ Solving problems together

The points break-down for grading looks something like this:

+ 50 points coding
+ 40 points participation
+ extra points for accelerated content
+ extra points for exceptional participation

This is foremost a course about _how_ to program. When faced with a homework
problem, such as "compute the descriptive statistics for a set of numbers", you
could very easily `import statistics` instead of writing the code yourself. In
a professional setting, you _should_ do that. However, the goal here isn't to
_solve_ a problem but to _learn_ how to solve a problem. In many programming
courses, the instructors have automated grading. I would never do that, because
that would mean that the focus was on getting the code to provide the correct
answer. In this course, the focus is on what the code looks like more than what
it does. It's better to have beautiful code that is broken than ugly code that
solves the problem correctly.

## Collaboration vs Plagiarism ##

In this course, you are encouraged to collaborate with other students. If you
work closely with other students, it's entirely possible you will have the
exact same code. In some classes that might be considered plagiarism, but not
here. Each homework assignment has a section where you can list the names of
the collaborators. Not only is this not plagiarism, it's actually encouraged,
and counts towards your participation grade! Just fill out the names of the
authors. It looks like this:

```
# Authors: Ian, Keith, Hannah
```

Working with people is very different from copy-pasting code from the Internet.
If you take answers from the Internet without attribution, it is considered
plagiarism. If you take answers from the Internet and state where you got the
information, it is not plagiarism. However, it's also not recommended.

In this course, you are not allowed to use any concept unless it has been
introduced in a previous or current unit. Do you already know how to write
functions? Good for you, but you aren't allowed to use them until they have
been formally introduced in unit 6. Want to use numpy or pandas? Sorry, we
never use those in this course. Looking up answers on the Internet will
frequently end with code that you're not allowed to use. Programs with
_illegal_ solutions will be penalized. Programs with plagiarism will be
reported to student judial affairs.

In general, resist copy-paste. Typing words helps you remember what you did
later. Copy-paste is one of the worst ways to learn how to program. Also,
copy-paste is one of the greatest sources of silent programming errors and
plagiarism.

## Course Content ##

Each unit of the course corresponds to 1 week. This is the standard track.

+ Unit 0: Tools of the trade
+ Unit 1: Unix basics
+ Unit 2: Math, variables, conditionals, and loops
+ Unit 3: Strings
+ Unit 4: Lists and tuples
+ Unit 5: Sequence algorithms
+ Unit 6: Functions
+ Unit 7: Files and CLI
+ Unit 8: Dictionaries
+ Unit 9: Final Project

Content on the accelerated track can be completed in any order. Most of the
content assumes you have already completed the stadnard track.

+ Unit A: Regular expressions
+ Unit B: Multidimensional data structures
+ Unit C: Optimizing performance
+ Unit D: Libraries, exceptions, and testing
+ Unit E: Object-oriented programming and API documentation
+ Unit F: Advanced projects

## Getting Good ##

One of the best ways to practice programming is to write the same program over
and over. Repetition is just as important in programming as it is in something
like music or sports. After spending 30 minutes writing a program, you might
feel like throwing it away and re-writing it would be dumb. And yet, it's the
smartest thing you can do.

## Getting Help ##

The instructor and TA monitor the course Discord server, so asking questions in
the #mcb185 channel will get you the fastest response. You may get answers from
other students even sooner. Email will also work.

## Getting Started ##

This course is organized as a GitHub repository. GitHub is a website that lets
you store and manage Git repositories. While Git was designed for source code
management, it can be used to manage all kinds of projects. Git allows multiple
people to work on the same files without anyone over-writing anyone else's
work. You will always know who did what and when.

There are several services similar to GitHub, but GitHub is the most popular.
Every bioinformatics developer should have a GitHub account. Your repositories
and activity are part of your CV. If you don't have a GitHub account, it's time
to point your web browser to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an
account.

Choose a username. Your GitHub account will be part of your CV, so choose a
name that you won't be embarrassed by in a few years. I use my full name. After
setting your email and password, choose the free plan and then answer a few
questions about your interests to create your account. Go to your email to
verify your email address.

Point your web browser to https://github.com/iankorf/MCB185. At the top of the
page, there is a button labeled **Fork**. Click the button. This will present a
page with a **Create Fork** button at the bottom. By clicking this button, you
will add a copy of the course materials to your personal GitHub account. You
are now ready to start Unit 0 (look at the `README.md` file there).
