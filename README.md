MCB185: Programming for Biologists
==================================

Organization

- Unit 1: Getting Started (4 weeks)
- Unit 2: Learning to Program (3 weeks)
- Unit 3: Practical Programming (3 weeks)

Grading

- Good To Go: 10 points
- Warmup Exercises: 30 points
- Midterm Exams: 60 points
- Final: 20 points (optional)
- Homework Repository: 5 points

If you have planned absences (e.g. you must leave town for an interview), you may schedule a make-up warmup exercise or midterm exam. If you have unplanned absences (e.g. COVID), please contact your instructor to determine the best course of action.

You earn 10 points when your computer environment is declared "good to go" (GTG) by the Professor or TA. This means you have all of the necessary software installed and your coding environment is rationally organized. You cannot proceed with the rest of the course until you are deemed GTG.

There are 3 warmup exercises before each midterm. You get the full 5 points for participating in each warmup, but you are limited to 10 points total (i.e. you get full credit if you take part in 2 out of 3). If you are unable to do the warmup exercise in person, may be able to do it online with the Professor or TA for reduced points.

There are 3 midterm exams. You will not have access to your computer or notes. Most exam questions will be VERY SIMILAR to the programming examples of each unit and warmup exercises.

The final exam is optional. The final exam replaces the lowest midterm exam score even if the final is lower. There is therefore some risk that taking the final exam will reduce your final grade.

Your GitHub mcb185_homework repo is worth up to 5 points. To get maximum credit, the repo should be organized, the homework programs should be complete, and you should have regular commits. Checking in a bunch of stuff at the last minute will earn a maximum of 1 point.
