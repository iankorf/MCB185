Ch-ch-ch-changes coming...

## Intent ##

In this course, you will learn computer programming in a biological context.
This is not so much a science course as a software engineering course with a
molecular biology theme. Along with programming, you will be introduced to some
essential bioinformatics skills and standards.

## Experience, Aptitude, and Grading ##

Some students come to the class with previous programming experience. Some
students learn programming concepts faster than others. Some students have more
time to study than others. For these reasons, not every student will start or
end at the same place. In order to accomodate different learning trajectories,
there are 2 tracks through the course: standard and accelerated.

On the standard path, the class moves at a pace that matches the syllabus (Unit
0 through Unit 9). The maximum grade on the standard path is a B+. In order to
attain the maximum grade, you must have completed all of the homework
assignments correctly and have been an active participant in class.

Any student, at any time, may decide to go to the accelerated path and learn
extra content (Unit A through Unit F). The only way to earn an A-, A, or A+ is
on the accelerated path. Being on the accelerated path doesn't guaranty a
higher grade. You must still complete all of the assignments correctly and be
an active participant in the class.

## Programming Progression ##

Your development as a programmer will not be linear. Some concepts will be easy
and others will be hard. In order to become a high level programmer, you need
to understand about 100 new concepts. Each of these concepts will make you
pause for between 1 minute and forever (seriously, I know programmers who still
don't understand pointer arithmetic - incidentally, not part of this course).
How long you get stuck is partly up to you. You might not be able to get to the
next level of understanding by yourself. The solution is to **ask for help**.
If you find yourself stuck for more than 20 minutes, stop banging your head
against a wall and ask someone for help! Every time you ask for help, at least
two people win.

Unlike most of your other classes, there is no penalty for working with another
student. In fact, you're encouraged to do so. Programming *should* be done in
pairs or small groups. That's how software gets written in the real world, so
that's how you should do it in class.

## No Shortcuts ##

This is foremost a course about *how* to program. When faced with a homework
problem, such as "compute the descriptive statistics for a set of numbers", you
could very easily `import statistics` instead of writing the code yourself. In
a professional setting, you *should* do that. However, the goal here isn't to
solve a problem but to learn *how* to solve a problem. For this reason, it's
important for you to write your own code. Even when you work in a small group,
everyone should write their own code.

Resist copy-paste. Typing words helps you remember what you did later.
Copy-paste is one of the worst ways to learn how to program. Also, copy-paste
is one of the greatest sources of silent programming errors.

In this course, you are not allowed to use any concept unless it has been
introduced in a previous or current unit. Do you already know how to use
dictionaries? Good for you, but you aren't allowed to use them until they have
been formally introduced. Want to use numpy or pandas? Sorry, we never use
those in this course. Looking up answers on the Internet will frequently end up
in code that you're not allowed to use. Assignments with _illegal_ solutions
will be marked as incorrect and receive no credit. The `REFERENCE.md` file has
a chronological description of Python concepts.

## Style ##

In this course, you must use tabs for left-side indentation. No spaces are
allowed on the left (but you should use them to align text on the right). Your
editor may be set up to insert 2 or 4 spaces instead of tabs. Turn that off.

Why is this a rule?

+ Helps discourage copy-paste from Internet sources
+ Indentation errors are annoying
+ Sometimes in life you have to follow arbitrary rules to succeed

There is a historic convention that source code lines shouldn't be longer than
80 characters. In this class, we follow the 80-column rule. Assignments that
break the style rules will be marked as incorrect and receive no credit.

## Course Content ##

Each unit of the course corresponds to 1 week.

+ Unit 0: Tools of the Trade
+ Unit 1: Basic Unix

+ Unit 7: Advanced Unix and CLI
+ Unit 8: Dictionaries
+ Unit 9: Final Project

Accelerated Path Content can be completed in any order.

+ Unit D: Object-Oriented Programming
+ Unit E: Testing and Exceptions
+ Unit F: Persistence
+ Unit G: IPC
+ Unit H: 
+ Unit I: Advanced Final Projects



## Getting Good ##

One of the best ways to practice programming is to write the same program over
and over. We call this a ground-zero re-write. Practice is just as important in
programming as it is in something like music or sports. Doing a ground-zero
re-write of your homework exercises will make you a much better programmer.

## Getting Help ##

The instructor and TA monitor the course Discord server, so asking questions in
the #mcb185 channel will get you the fastest response. You may get answers from
other students even sooner. Email will also work.

## Rules ##

It's worth re-stating some rules of the course.

+ No programming constructs more advanced than the current unit
+ No importing libraries unless they have been previously introduced
+ Use tabs for left-side indentation only
+ Follow the 80-column rule
+ No penalty for working with other students
